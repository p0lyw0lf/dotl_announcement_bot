**Command help**

If you have already run the `admin_role` command, this command restricts usage of a command to only those who have that admin role. There is no multiple-tier permission system yet.

```
b!restrict_command [command] {restrict?}
```

If the `restrict?` arg is `no`, then the command becomes unrestricted.
