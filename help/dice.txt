**Dice help**

Now you can simulate dice rolls without leaving the comfort of your Discord window!

Variables:
```
dice size: Number of faces the dice has. Minimum 2. (Default: 6)
```

Commands:
```
roll
d[x]
```
where x is in the list `[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20]`

Examples:
```
b!roll 4        # rolls a 4-sided die
b!roll d4       # same thing, ignores the d
b!roll d4 2     # rolls 2 4-sided dice, adds them together
b!roll 2 d4     # same as before, can switch arguments
b!d4            # shorter way to roll specified dice.
b!d4 2          # same thing, only rolls 2 and adds
```

Coming eventually: Dice images. 
Required materials for this to happen:
 * Coin faces for size 2
 * Triangle w/ number for size 4
 * Dots for size 6
 * d20 triangles
 * Somewhere to host these images (Discord has a rate-limit for uploading, but not for linking)
