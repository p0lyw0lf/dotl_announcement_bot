**Filter help**

If you did not know already, the Dotl server is against profanity.
To help the mods, Dotl Bud provides an auto-censor feature that detects profanity,deletes the original message, and re-sends a censored version.
The filter can be defeated, yes, but the rationale behind this is to preserve any messages users might send that accidentally contain profanity, while still preserving their contents.
