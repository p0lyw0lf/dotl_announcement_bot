**Filter help**

If you did not know already, the Dotl server is against profanity.
To help the mods, Dotl Bud provides an auto-censor feature that detects profanity,deletes the original message, and re-sends a censored version.
The filter can be defeated, yes, but the rationale behind this is to preserve any messages users might send that accidentally contain profanity, while still preserving their contents.

Commands:
```
[] = required
{} = optional
filter_word [word]
    Adds a word to the profanity filter
unfilter_word [word]
    Removes a word from the profanity filter
```
