**Probation help**

On the DotL discord server, we have system in place to keep track of warnings, how many times a user has egregiously broken the server rules.
These warnings can be given or removed at the discretion of server moderators, and once a user has accumulated too many, they are put on probation or banned.

Probation entails being muted for 1 day, and a removal of the Bud role for 2 weeks. This punishment should not be taken lightly.

Commands:
```
[] = required
{} = optional
[user] arguments can be specified by an @mention, a username, or a user id
probation [user]
    Puts a user on probation, and gives them a warning if they don't have any already
warn [user]
    Increments the number of warnings a user has
unwarn [user]
    Decrements the number of warnings a user has (can't go lower than zero)
warninfo {user}
    Gets the number of warnings and probation status for the user calling the command, or a specified user.
member_role [role_id]
    Sets the role for people not on probation, aka the Bud role
muted_role [role_id]
    Sets the role for muted probation users
```
