**RSS Feed help**

Dotl Bud contains a feature to parse the RSS feeds for Dotl's, Meg's, and Yoko's websites and send alerts when any new content is posted.
If the new content doesn't show up immediately, be patient! The RSS often lags a few minutes behind the actual postings, and Dotl Bud only checks for new postings every 10min anyway.

If any new RSS feeds need to be added, please contact PolyWolf.
