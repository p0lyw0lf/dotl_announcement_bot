**Variables help**

Variables are DotL Bud's way of storing data both for specific users and in general.
DotL Bud will use these variables to configure itself, to store offline user data, or to customize commands.

While nearly every module uses these variables to some degree.

Commands:
```
set
get
```

Basic variables:
```
delete_command
delete_response
delete_response_time
```

Use `help variables [variable_name]` for more information
