**Variables help**

Variables are DotL Bud's way of storing data both for specific users and in general.
DotL Bud will use these variables to configure itself, to store offline user data,
or to customize commands.

While nearly every module uses these variables, this help page is only deals with the basics
of setting and retrieving variables.

To manually retrieve the value of the variable:
```
b!get {global} [variable_name]
```

Argument description:
```
 1: optional, if included get the global default variable instead of the user-specific one
 2-n: A space-separated list of words representing the variable name
```

To set a variable:
```
b!set {global} [variable_name] [value]
```

Argument description:
```
 1: optional, if included get the global default variable instead of the user-specific one
 2-(n-1): A space-separated list of words representing the variable name
 n: The value to set the variable to. Enclose in quotes ("like so") if spaces are in the value.
```

Basic variables:
```
delete_command:
 Values: yes/no
 Description: When you run a command, should DotL Bud delete what you typed?
 Default: no
delete_response:
